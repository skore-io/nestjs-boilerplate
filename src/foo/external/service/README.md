# Service

This directory contains the Service files.
The service encapsulates the application's business logic, controlling transactions and coordinating the implementation of operations.

We seek to implement granular services to cut down on the amount of functionality offered by a service, the granularity of the data that is exchanged with it, and the granularity of the business logic of a service.

After create a file in this directory you need to import it as provider in the module.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/providers#services).
