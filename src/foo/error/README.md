# Error

This directory contains the Error files.
We centralize the errors in a class of enums, to make it easier to translate the error (into our supported languages) on the clients that are consuming our APIs.

An example about the usage of this directory [here](https://github.com/skore-io/messaging/blob/develop/src/chatbot/error/chatbot.error.ts).
